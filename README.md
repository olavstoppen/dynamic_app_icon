# dynamic_app_icon

A plugin that lets you change the icon for the app dynamically.

## Getting Started

Please note, you need to add the icons to the Info.plist of the app project, and add the graphics as @2x and @3x in a folder called AlternateIcons.

Take a look at the example project to see how its supposed to be for things to work.
